Module One Final Project: Welp
========================

This our command line CRUD app that allows users to place (imaginary) orders with restaurants, and keep track of their faves.

The restaurants database is seeded from the Yelp Fusion API.

User Stories
========================

- As a user, you can create, update, and delete your user account.

- You can search for restaurants based on price, or a category of food. Or you an ask for a random restaurant suggestion and decide to order from it or not.

- After you place orders, you can rate the order, and choose to add the restaurant to your list of favorites.

- You can view the list of restaurants you've previously ordered from and re-order if you'd like.

- You can also view your favorites, and re-order or remove a restaurant from your list of favorites.

To play around with our project, run the application through the run file `ruby bin/run.rb`
